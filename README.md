#Absent 
Work in progress prototype for making presentations in markdown.

##To install

`npm install -g cenau/absent`

##To use 

`absent <markdown file>`

##Special formatting

Line breaks `---` are used to mark the end of a slide. 

Images `![](image.png)`are used as the background of the slide. The last image you include on a slide will be used.

##For help

`absent --help`

And take a look in the `demo` folder

##Why?

Most of my presentations are a collection of images with a title on each slide. 

I just want to be able to assemble my titles and pictues and present it - for me, that means getting it on whatever shonky projecter via whatever bizarre means are mandated. So fixed size PDFs are the way to go. 

Powerpoint is actually _astonishingly bad_ at this (not knocking powerpoint, it is good for other things) , and laying stuff out in latex is practically a fetish its so painful.
